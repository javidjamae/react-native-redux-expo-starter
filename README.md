# About react-native-redux-expo-starter

This is a starter project that builds on top of Expo to wire together a
basic react-native app that uses redux. It includes react-redux and
wire in redux-thunk as middleware.

The app is merely a placeholder component that has a TextInput which
replicates its contents into a Text field using the redux state.
